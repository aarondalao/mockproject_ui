# Mock Project UI

The purpose of this repository is to aid individuals who wants to start a career in the web. It is a part of an intended full tutorial which consists of front-end, REST API, back-end, and object-oriented programming paradigm. The individual can create this project on scratch (vanilla JS and CSS) or any library and frameworks such as Angular, Vue, React, Bootstrap, etc. 

I apply basic layout and feature in the user-interface which develops necessary skills in todays industry in an entry level position.

## Author

I am an aspiring web developer who wants to improve my skills. I am once trapped by the black hole meaning i relied on many tutorials from Udemy, Pluralsight, YouTube which I think is good but not a reliable way of learning. Why? First, tutorials are created in a specific time which will eventually going to be outdated. Second, most tutorial projects are unrealistic and only tailored to the instructors' interest. Lastly, everyone has different ways of learning which I think, relying on tutorials limits the individuals capability and creativity.

## My take away

Anyone has a capabality to learn and anyting can be learn. Create project base on your ideas and interest. I am sure you will not get stuck and will enjoy developing in the process. Always read the official documentation for authenticated information. Create a plan by setting a goal, milestone, diagrams, and flow chart first before coding.
